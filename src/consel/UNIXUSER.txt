CONSEL: a program for assessing the confidence of phylogenetic tree selection
=============================================================================

CONSEL UNIX-source
Time-stamp: "2001-06-11 11:11:40 shimo"


 INSTALL
=========

The programs are at "src" directory. The following commands are to
compile them and move the binaries to the "bin" directory.

cd src
make
make install
make clean
cd ..


 EXAMPLE
=========

Some example files are at "example" directory. To check whether the
program works or not, type the following commands:

cd example
./test.sh
cat error.log
cd ..

If there are errors, you will see something other than time stamps in
the file "error.log".

Further examples may help you to know the usage of CONSEL. You can try

cd example
./sample1.sh
./sample2.sh
cd ..

sample1 may take a few minutes to finish. sample2 takes only a few seconds.
