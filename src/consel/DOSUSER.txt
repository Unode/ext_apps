CONSEL: a program for assessing the confidence of phylogenetic tree selection
=============================================================================

Time-stamp: "2001-06-11 11:10:23 shimo"


 INSTALL
=========

Simply execute the self-extracting archive "cnslb01.exe", and follow
the instructions. You will be asked the program directory (default:
c:\Program Files\consel) and the work directory (default:
"desktop"\consel).  The installer will prepare the desktop shortcuts
and the start menu (start->program->consel) too.  You can uninstall
CONSEL programs by clicking the "uninstall" shortcut in the start
menu. The user's guide "program.pdf" is found in the start menu.


 STARTING CONSEL CONSOLE
=========================

Clock the "CONSEL" shortcut on the desktop. It will start up the
command console, setting the appropriate PATH, and change directory to
the work directory. You can type any commands of CONSEL, such as
makermt, consel, or catpv, from the console.


 EXAMPLE
=========

Some example files are at "example" directory. Type the following
commands from the console.

cd example
sample1.bat

It runs makermt for generating the bootstrap replicates from the
sample file of 15 mammal trees. It will take a few minutes to
finish. The p-values are calculated by consel, and shown by catpv.

Following sample1.bat, you can try another example by typing:

sample2.bat

This calculates the p-values for the edges to test the monophyly. It
takes only a few seconds, since the bootstrap replicates are already
generated in sample1.bat.

You can compare the outputs of these examples with those found in
"result" sub-directory. They should be identical to the outputs of the
samples when CONSEL is working fine.
